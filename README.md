Program for solving sudoku problems

Currently only solves really simple sudoku problems


# Setup
The project uses pytest for testing and black for source code formatting.

The easiest installation process is installing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) 
and then running `poetry install`.

The tests are then simply run by running `pytest` in the directory root.
